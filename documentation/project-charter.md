# Project Charter

## Project Name

MentorSync – Academic Coordination System

## Problem Statement

In academic environments, mentor allocation and assignment tracking are often managed manually or across multiple disconnected platforms. This leads to reduced visibility, delayed evaluations, unclear accountability, and inefficient coordination between admin, mentors, and students.

## Objective

To design and deploy a centralized web-based system within 4 weeks that streamlines mentor allocation, tracks assignment progress, and improves visibility for all stakeholders.
